# System X Documentation

## Introduction

System X is a software solution developed by **Engineering Team X** to provide critical business capabilitiesâ€”**Capability A** and **Capability B**. This documentation offers a comprehensive overview of System X, detailing its architecture, components, team structure, and the value it brings to users.

---

## Overview

System X is composed of a **Web Application** and **Database X**. The web application serves as the user interface, while Database X handles data storage and retrieval. Together, they deliver seamless access to Capabilities A and B, enhancing user productivity and satisfaction.

---

## Business Capabilities

### Capability A

*Capability A* allows users to **manage their personal profiles**, including updating contact information, preferences, and security settings. This capability ensures that user data is current and secure, facilitating personalized experiences.

### Capability B

*Capability B* enables users to **generate and analyze performance reports**. Users can create custom reports, visualize data trends, and export insights for decision-making purposes.

---

## System Architecture

System X is designed with a modular architecture, promoting scalability and ease of maintenance.
